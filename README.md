# **Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a dataset focused on mobile device usage and user behavior. The analysis includes the development of a linear regression model to uncover insights and understand patterns in user behavior.

## **Project Overview**

- To analyze and clean raw data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihyavuzz/smartphone-sales?select=smartphones.csv).
- To build a robust linear regression model and explore the impact of adding additional variables and interactions.
- To test hypotheses related to the model, check for multicollinearity, and validate assumptions through diagnostic tests.
- To present findings with clear graphical representations and detailed interpretations.
  
## **Files and Directories**

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `code.r/`: R scripts for data analysis and model building.
- `README.md`: Project overview and guidance.

## **Instructions**

- Run the R scripts in `code.r/` to reproduce the results.
