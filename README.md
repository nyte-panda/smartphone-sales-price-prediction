# **Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a dataset focused on mobile device usage and user behavior. The analysis includes the development of a linear regression model to uncover insights and understand patterns in user behavior.

## **Project Overview**

- To analyze and clean raw data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihyavuzz/smartphone-sales?select=smartphones.csv).
- To build a robust linear regression model and explore the impact of adding additional variables and interactions.
- To test hypotheses related to the model, check for multicollinearity, and validate assumptions through diagnostic tests.
- To present findings with clear graphical representations and detailed interpretations.

## **Project Structure**

1. Executive Summary: Highlights the purpose of the project, key findings, and pros/cons of the models.
2. Introduction: Provides an overview of the raw data and brief literature on similar models.
3. Model Development Process and Diagnostics: Outlines data exploration, model building, tests, diagnostics, and conclusions from visual and statistical analysis.
4. Conclusion: Summarizes findings and suggests potential improvements.
5. Appendices: Includes R code and optional intermediate results.
